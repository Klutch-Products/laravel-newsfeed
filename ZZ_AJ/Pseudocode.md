# Pseudocode



- Classic MVC Blog, refactored with Python using Flask.

- Refactored with PostgreSQL 

- Instead of just using dummy seed data, utilize google trends to pull current trending searches and use those as seed data.

- need to have the data model set up before I can start working on the views and controllers.

- based on the trending searches, I will create save those as a topic, then have the fake users create posts about those topics, utilizing the faker library to create fake users and posts, or OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate fake posts.

- I will also incorporate visualizations of the data, using matplotlib and seaborn.

- I will also incorporate a sentiment analysis of the posts, using the vaderSentiment library.

- I will also incorporate a word cloud of the posts, using the wordcloud library.

- blog posts can be rotten or fresh , like rotten tomatoes movie reviews.
- 
- for the views, I will use a templating engine like Jinja2.
- Questions to ask:
- How do I get the trending searches from google trends?
