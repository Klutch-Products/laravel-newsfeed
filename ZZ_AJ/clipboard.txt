================

- JSON Code for querying posts:

{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "How to Learn Python",
  "user_id": 2,
  "user": {
    "id": 2,
    "username": "lernantino" // post author
  },
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "comment_text": "Great article!",
      "post_id": 1,
      "user_id": 3,
      "user": {
        "id": 3,
        "username": "someone_else" // comment author
      }
    }
  ]
}

Add Error Handling
A signup error can occur in several situations, like any of the following examples:

A user signs up with an email address that's already in use.

A user's email address doesn't contain an at-sign character (@).

A user's password is fewer than five characters in length.

Fortunately, the User model is set up to throw an error when these cases happenâ€”thanks to the unique=True option on the email field and the validations that use assert.
