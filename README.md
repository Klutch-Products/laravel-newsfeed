Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time. -->

## How to Contribute

<!-- If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer. -->
- My next goal for the project is to add a feature that allows users to upload images to their posts.
- I would also like to encorporate the use of the faker library to generate fake users and posts.
- I would also like to add a feature that shows the highest rated posts on the home page, and a feature that allows users to rate posts.
